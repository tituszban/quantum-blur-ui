# Quantum Blur UI

This is a UI created to allow playing around with [Qiskit QuantumBlur](https://github.com/qiskit-community/QuantumBlur?tab=readme-ov-file).

It had to be heavily modified to (1) Work and (2) have proper type hint support. Performance is still not great...

It also here for me to try out [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and fully Firebase native apps.
